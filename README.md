Caesar Cipher GUI Application  This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar Cipher encryption technique. 
The Caesar Cipher is a simple and classic method where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.
 A simple, intuitive interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to easily input text and select encryption or decryption options. Encrypt any text by shifting its characters using a user-defined key. Decrypt ciphered text with the same shift key used for encryption. Input any numeric value as the shift key to customize the encryption.The program accurately shifts both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. View the encrypted or decrypted text in real-time with the click of a button
