# PRODIGY_CS_01
Caesar Cipher GUI Application  This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar Cipher encryption technique. The Caesar Cipher is a simple and classic method where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.
Features:User-Friendly GUI: A simple, intuitive interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to easily input text and select encryption or decryption options.
    Encryption: Encrypt any text by shifting its characters using a user-defined key.
    Decryption: Decrypt ciphered text with the same shift key used for encryption.
    Custom Shift Key: Input any numeric value as the shift key to customize the encryption.
    Supports Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: The program accurately shifts both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
    Instant Feedback: View the encrypted or decrypted text in real-time with the click of a button
